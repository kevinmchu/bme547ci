# bme547ci
This is the continuous integration testing assignment for BME 547, Spring 2019.

The python files are tachycardia.py and test_tachycardia.py. tachycardia.py contains a module called is_tachycardic that takes a string as an input and determines whether it contains the word tachycardic. test_tachycardia.py contains unit tests that are used to check if tachycardia.py correctly determines whether a string contains the word tachycardic.
